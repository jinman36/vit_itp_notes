# ITP Week 4 Day 2 Exercise

#Today we will pull information from the Pokemon api, put it into a dictionary, and then put that info into a new Excel file.  We will write the pseudocode as a group in class.  Be sure to follow the pseudocode, break your problems down into smaller pieces, and consult the documentation whenever you get stuck: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon

#PSEUDO-CODE:

#GET NAME AND ABILITY FROM API
#PUT INFO IN DICTIONARY
#ADD THE DICTIONARY TO A NEW EXCEL WORKBOOK

#imports:
    #json
    #openpyxl
import requests
import json
import openpyxl
import pandas as pd

#Input
    #json file from pokemon api
    #workbook
#Assign response to variable
response = requests.get('https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon')

# print(clean_data)

#Create workbook
    #get workbook from openpy
    #load workbook
    #assign workbook to variable
#Create Worksheet
    #assign sheet to variable
    
wb = openpyxl.load_workbook('week_four/day_2/output.xlsx')

#Create a dictionary, assign to variable
